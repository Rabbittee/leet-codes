## Solution

### Step 1

Declare depth, and if there is no root then return depth,
and final will return plus one.

### Step 2

Check each child behide root. Then find the maximum depth and the next child depth. Then final will return the maximum plus one.

### Complexity

- Space complexity

  Linked list is `O(1)`,

- Time complexity

  for loop `O(n)`
