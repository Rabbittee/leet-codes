## Solution

### Step 1

Create a has table to store count of all nums

### Step 2

if one of nums in hash map if count to 2, return true.
Finally return false

### Complexity

- Space complexity

  If all nums is not duplicate, the space usage is `O(n)`,

- Time complexity

  We go through all nums if needed, time usage is `O(n)`
