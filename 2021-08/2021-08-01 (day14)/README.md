# 64. Minimum Path Sum

Medium

## Description

Given a `m` `x` `n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

*Note:* You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
