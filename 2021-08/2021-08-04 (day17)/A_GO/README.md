Medium

## Description

You are given two _non-empty_ linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in _reverse order_, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
