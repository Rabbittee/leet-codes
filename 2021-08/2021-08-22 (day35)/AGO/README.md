# 1039. Find the Town Judge

`Easy`

## Description

<p>In a town, there are <code>n</code> people labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.</p>

<p>If the town judge exists, then:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The town judge trusts nobody.</li>
	<li>Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.</li>
	<li>There is exactly one person that satisfies properties <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are given an array <code>trust</code> where <code>trust[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> representing that the person labeled <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> trusts the person labeled <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return </em><code>-1</code><em> otherwise</em>.</p>

## Thought

We use an array to store points,

- If A trust someone, a get one point.
- If A trusted by someone, a lose one point.

`A judge should trust no one and trusted by all others.`

So we need to find someone points is -(N-1)
if not found, return -1.
